# Weather Classification Neural Network Project

This project implements a deep learning solution for weather classification using both custom ResNet architecture and transfer learning approaches with Xception and DenseNet models. The project uses a subset of the BDD100K Weather Classification dataset to classify weather conditions in images.

## Development Environment

- **Platform**: Kaggle Notebooks
- **Hardware**: GPU (P100/T4)
- **Runtime Type**: Python with GPU acceleration
- **Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras

## Dataset

- **Source**: [BDD100K Weather Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marquis03/bdd100k-weather-classification)
- **Sample Size**: 30,000 images
- **Classes**: 
  - Clear
  - Overcast
  - Partly Cloudy
  - Rainy
  - Snowy
  - Unknown

## Model Architectures

### Custom ResNet Implementation
- Built from scratch implementation of ResNet architecture
- Includes residual connections and deep convolutional layers
- Trained end-to-end on the weather classification task

### Transfer Learning Models
1. **Xception**
   - Pre-trained weights from ImageNet
   - Fine-tuned for weather classification
   - Modified top layers for 6-class classification

2. **DenseNet**
   - Pre-trained weights from ImageNet
   - Leverages dense connectivity pattern
   - Adapted for weather classification task

## Performance Metrics

The following metrics are used to evaluate model performance:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC Curves
- AUC Scores

### Visualizations
- Confusion Matrix
- ROC Curves
- Training/Validation Loss & Accuracy Curves
